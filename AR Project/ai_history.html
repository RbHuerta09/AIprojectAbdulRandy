                    1950: Alan Turing, a well known mathmatician and computer sicentist, published a paper, called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" that proposed a quetion: Can machines think?
                    He also introduced a new, and to be well known idea:
                    <h1 class="text-warning fs-1">The Turing Test</h1>
                    This method to measure machine intelligence, which is explained on the image to the right.
                    Turing proposed question that led to decades upon decade of research, but unmfortunately he wouldnt get to see what it would become, because shortly after, he commited suicide in 1954.

                    1956: The man shown on the left is named John McCarthy, a professor from the popular Ivy League school, Dartmouth Univesity.
                    It was there at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 that he organized, where he gathered up a small team of people in a summer workshop to look into a project.
                    Laboratories focused on this were established around the world and were heavily funded during the 60s.
                    Many names were thrown around, like "Thinking Machines", "Automata Theory", or "Cybernetics".
                    Here at the Darthmouth Conference, there were many names for this thrown around, like "Thinking Machines", Or "Automata Theory", and "Cybernetics".
                    But it was on that day, that a new term was birthed:
                    <h1 class="text-warning fs-1">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>

                  1966: Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist and professor, developed one of the first natural language processing programs.
                  This program was called ELIZA, which was the first computer therapist, it was of course limited because it was the first of its kind.
                  In the video, a snippet from Young Sheldon taking place in the 80s, we can see Sheldon's dissapointment when he talks to ELIZA.
