                    1956: The man shown on the left is named John McCarthy, a professor from the popular Ivy League school, Dartmouth Univesity. It was there at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 that he organized, where he gathered up a small team of people in a summer workshop to look into a project. Many names were thrown around, like "Thinking Machines", "Automata Theory", or "Cybernetics". But of course, we know it well, as Artificial Intelligence, or otherwise known as AI. The Dartmouth Conference is considered to be the birth of Artificial Intelligence. AI Laboratories were everywhere around the world and were heavily funded during the 60s.
